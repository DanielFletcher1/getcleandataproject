Code Book
=================

This code book modifies the "Features Selection" or features_info.txt file available in this
repo at https://github.com/DanielFletcher1/getcleandataproject/blob/master/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset/features_info.txt.

Instead of rewriting every line from the "Features Selection" file, the purpose of this code book is to give a brief synposis of the variables and units used within this getcleandataproject analysis, leading to the tidydataset.txt file.

In addition to the numerous variables, below, the "tidy data set" in this repo associates train and test subject IDs with each observation (all the various variables captured by the smartphones), 1-30.

Finally, an added value of the tidy data set in this repo is the appending of the physical activities video recorded during the study:

"WALKING"
"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
"SITTING"
"STANDING"
"LAYING

As indicated in the README.MD file of this repo (https://github.com/DanielFletcher1/getcleandataproject/blob/master/README.md), the tidy data set also combines a subset of mean/standard deviation variables and gives their average, broken down by subject ID and physical activity, providing summarized calculations unavailble in the raw data.


Original Variables with summary
==================================


Variables1:

tAcc-XYZ (raw accelerometer time signals)
tGyro-XYZ (raw gyroscope time signals)

Units1:  captured at a frequency of 50 Hz, then filtered at 20 Hz "to remove noise"


Variables2 - taken from the accelration signal:

tBodyAcc-XYZ (body acceleration time signals)
tGravityAcc-XYZ (gravity acceleration time signals)

Units2:  filtered at a frequency of 0.3 Hz.


Variables3:

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ (raw body jerk time signals from the accelerometer)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ (raw body jerk time signals from the gyroscope)

{3D signals calculated from the Euclidean norm:}

tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag


Variables4:

{Frequency domain signals - XYZ indicates signals in the directions X, Y, Z.}

fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


Estimates derived from the above variables (from original code book):

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
